            Helen and Caron founded Thread with a shared belief that no one
            should feel alone or overwhelmed by everyday paperwork and
            appointments. With a calm, compassionate approach, they bring
            patience, understanding and practical support to people who need a
            helping hand. Their focus is on making things feel clearer, more
            manageable and far less stressful, one step at a time.

            We’ve both spent many years working alongside individuals and
            families who feel overwhelmed by letters, forms, appointments and
            complex systems. We wanted to create something calm, practical and
            approachable — support that works alongside existing services, not
            instead of them.
